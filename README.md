        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>*Beth and Tim Edwards are my parents including Luke and Emma. (my siblings)* They met at Millersville University where Tim played 2 years of college basketball in the PSAC (NCAA Division II Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference). Tim played his high school basketball at Strath Haven c/o 1996. In Tim's final 2 years at Millersville, he decided to become a referee and started officiating games in the Lancaster County Chapter as well as in the Philadelphia Catholic, Inter-Ac and Central Leagues. He officiated for 20 seasons, having worked the NBA Summer League 3 times, NCAA Division I, II, III and high school. Tim stopped officiating in order to not miss any of his sons' games. Starting in Luke's junior season, both Tim and Beth were able to watch every game together, and see their son lead his high school team to a state playoff berth. Also, Tim got to coach his younger son, Jack on a St. John's CYO team that won the parish's first ever Region 30 Championship. Beth was a college athlete as well, a soccer goalie. She has grown to love the game of basketball. We both love supporting our kids and surrounding community around the game of basketball!!.</p>
